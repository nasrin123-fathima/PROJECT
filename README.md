# ML PROJECT
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms using a Linear Regression model. It was developed as part of my internship to demonstrate foundational knowledge of machine learning and model building using real-world data.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

ðŸš€ Steps Followed
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values (if any)

Converted data into numeric format suitable for modeling

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized relationships using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps

Model Building

Used LinearRegression from sklearn

Trained model on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%

Model Evaluation

Evaluated using RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error

Plotted actual vs predicted prices for validation

ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output

Input: 1500 sqft, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms
Predicted Price: $265,000
âœ… Result
The model achieved a good fit on the test data with reasonable prediction accuracy. This task helped in understanding regression modeling and practical machine learning workflows.
